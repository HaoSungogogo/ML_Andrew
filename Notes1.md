Unsupervised learning


Supervised learning:
Given a large data set and already know what our correct output should like, it is to find the relationship between the input and output.

Type:
Regression: Trying to predict result within continuous output, meaning that we are trying to map the     
            input variables into some continuous function.
Classification: Trying to predict result within discrete output and try to map input variables into
                discrete categories.

Unsupervised Learning:
clustering



Regression
Linear Regression
h(x) = ax + b -> find a, b -> minimize sum (h(x) - y)^2
